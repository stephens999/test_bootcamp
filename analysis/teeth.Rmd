## Introduction

This is going to be an anlysis of my teeth data. First I will
read the data in, and check it looks right:
```{r}
teeth <- read.csv("data/teeth.csv", row.names = 1)
head(teeth)
```


Now take a look at some boxplots
```{r}
boxplot(len ~ dose, data = teeth)
boxplot(len ~ supp, data = teeth)
boxplot(len ~ dose + supp, data = teeth)
```

Do a permutation test:

```{r}
# Observed difference in teeth length due to supplement method
mean(teeth$len[teeth$supp == "OJ"]) - mean(teeth$len[teeth$supp == "VC"])
# Permute the observations
supp_perm <- sample(teeth$supp)
# Calculate mean difference in permuted data
mean(teeth$len[supp_perm == "OJ"]) - mean(teeth$len[supp_perm == "VC"])
```
